## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Project tooling: Vitest replaces `node --test` (tests move to `tests/unit/`), ESLint,
  Prettier, EditorConfig, a TypeScript configuration ready for the migration, GitHub CI
  and release workflows.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- The language: definition, the five composition operators, routing primitives,
  substitution, iterators, interface parameters, entry point, imports.
- The transpiler: FaustX → Faust, a parser generated from `src/faustx.grammar`, the
  catalogue of Faust's 998 declared functions.
- A command line (`faustx`) and a library entry point.
- Live gestures: each one says what it touched and carries only the Faust that changed.
